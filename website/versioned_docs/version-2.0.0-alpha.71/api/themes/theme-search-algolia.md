This theme provides a `@theme/SearchBar` component that integrates with Algolia DocSearch easily. Combined with `@docusaurus/theme-classic`, it provides a very easy search integration. You can read more on [search](../../search.md) documentation.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @docusaurus/theme-search-algolia
```

This theme also adds search page available at `/search` (as swizzleable `SearchPage` component) path with OpenSearch support.

:::tip

If you have installed `@docusaurus/preset-classic`, you don't need to install it as a dependency.
