:::caution

For v1 translated sites, the migration doc is not available yet.

:::

This doc guides you through migrating an existing Docusaurus 1 site to Docusaurus 2.

We try to make this as easy as possible, and provide a migration cli.

## Docusaurus 1 structure

Your Docusaurus 1 site should have the following structure:

```sh
â”œâ”€â”€ docs
â””â”€â”€ website
    â”œâ”€â”€ blog
    â”œâ”€â”€ core
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Footer.js
    â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
    â”œâ”€â”€ pages
    â”œâ”€â”€ sidebars.json
    â”œâ”€â”€ siteConfig.js
    â””â”€â”€ static
```

## Docusaurus 2 structure

After the migration, your Docusaurus 2 site could look like:

```sh
â”œâ”€â”€ docs
â””â”€â”€ website
    â”œâ”€â”€ blog
    â”œâ”€â”€ src
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ css
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages
    â”œâ”€â”€ static
    â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
    â”œâ”€â”€ sidebars.json
    â”œâ”€â”€ docusaurus.config.js
```

:::info

This migration does not change the `/docs` folder location, but Docusaurus v2 sites generally have the `/docs` folder inside `/website`

You are free to put the `/docs` folder anywhere you want after having migrated to v2.

:::

## Migration process

There are multiple things to migrate to obtain a fully functional Docusaurus 2 website:

- packages
- cli commands
- site configuration
- markdown files
- sidebars file
- pages, components and CSS
- versioned docs
- i18n support ðŸš§

## Automated migration process

The [migration cli](./migration-automated.md) will handle many things of the migration for you.

However, some parts can't easily be automated, and you will have to fallback to the manual process.

:::note

We recommend running the migration cli, and complete the missing parts thanks to the manual migration process.

:::

## Manual migration process

Some parts of the migration can't be automated (particularly the pages), and you will have to migrate them manually.

The [manual migration guide](./migration-manual.md) will give you all the manual steps.

## Support

## Example migration PRs

You might want to refer to our migration PRs for [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/7785) and [Flux](https://github.com/facebook/flux/pull/471) as examples of how a migration for a basic Docusaurus v1 site can be done.
